# Wireless ECG Monitoring System With Remote Data Logging using PSoC

By Uttam U. Deshpande et. al.,

Programmable System on Chip (PSoC) processor performs rapid, complex signal processing and consumes low power. These PSoCâ€™s capabilities extend its use in designing intelligent wireless sensor node. ECG detection and processing system detects R peaks at regular intervals, calculate heart rate and classify it. High accuracy, low error rate and good noise immunity is achieved by simple thresholding technique. For longer sensor node life, power consumption plays a very essential role. Instead of logging data continuously to the base station, intelligent sensor node enables transmitter only when critical heart rate is observed. Further reduction in power consumption is achieved by using low power CY3271 sensor node itself. Power analysis shows reduction in power due to reduced transmission rate. This results in low traffic over the network.
